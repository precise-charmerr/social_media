Project preparation checklist

1. Define project requirements
   - Write a short spec: features, endpoints, user flows, non-functional requirements (scalability, performance, security, data retention). Save in `README.md` or `docs/spec.md`.

2. Design API & data models
   - Sketch REST/GraphQL API endpoints, request/response shapes, and domain data models (ERD). Create `api.md` and `models/` stubs under `backend/src/main/java` or `docs/`.

3. Choose database & migrations
   - Pick DB (Postgres/Mongo), plan schemas, add migration tool (Flyway/Liquibase) and create initial migration files. Add config in `application.properties` and `pom.xml` as needed.

4. Authentication & authorization
   - Decide auth method (JWT/OAuth2/session), user roles, and secure endpoints. Add security config (Spring Security) and related properties.

5. Local dev environment
   - Add run instructions, sample env files (`.env`, `application-dev.properties`), scripts to start DB and app (Maven command, `docker-compose.yml`).

6. Testing strategy
   - Add unit, integration, and end-to-end test plans. Configure test framework (JUnit/MockMvc), add example tests and CI test step.

7. Logging, monitoring & error handling
   - Configure structured logging (Logback/SLF4J), set log levels in `application.properties`, add basic metrics (Micrometer) and error handling strategy.

8. CI/CD pipeline
   - Create GitHub Actions / Jenkins pipeline: build, test, static analysis, container build and deploy steps. Add workflow file and badge to `README.md`.

9. Containerization
   - Add `Dockerfile` for backend, `docker-compose.yml` for multi-service local runs. Document how to build and run containers.

10. Code quality & linting
   - Add linters/formatters: Checkstyle/SpotBugs for Java, ESLint/Prettier for frontend. Configure in `pom.xml` and `package.json` and add pre-commit hooks.

11. Documentation & onboarding
   - Create `README.md` with setup steps, development workflow, conventions, and quickstart. Add API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI) and architecture overview.

12. Security & privacy review
   - Plan data protection (encryption, backups), secrets management, and OWASP checks. Document compliance needs (GDPR, etc.).
