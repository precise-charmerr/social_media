Points learnt while doing backend(springboot)

# details of pom.xml
* <modelVersion> this specifies that POM model will be used.
* <parent> Inherits configuration from the spring-boot-starter-parent POM. The spring-boot-starter-parent 
    provides default configurations for Spring Boot projects, such as dependency versions and plugin configurations.
	To see final pom.xml with <parent>, you can view it using: 
	mvn help:effective-pom									# produce effective POM to stdout
	mvn help:effective-pom -Doutput=effective-pom.xml		# or write it to a file to inspect
# or write it to a file to inspect
mvn help:effective-pom -Doutput=effective-pom.xml
* <properties> tell that java 17 will be used.
* <dependency> it will tell which JARs will be downloaded.
    1. spring-boot-starter-web -> helps working with REST APIs.
    2. spring-boot-starter-data-jpa -> helps working with database.
    3. mysql-connector-java -> provides jdbc driver for mySQL connection.
    4. spring-boot-starter-security -> helps with authentication and authorization.
    5. lombok -> helps with generating boilerplate code, getters/setters/constructor
    6. spring-boot-starter-test -> provides testing libraries.
* <build> helps configuring the build process.
    <plugin> in that which is `spring-boot-maven-plugin` enables Spring Boot-specific tasks like 
    running the application (mvn spring-boot:run) and creating executable JARs.
    <exclude> is excluding lombok from final JAR to not increase the size of it as when .class is created,
    lombok's job is to create getter/setter/constructor, so all this is done at compile time which is in
    .class, so during runtime lombok wont be required
